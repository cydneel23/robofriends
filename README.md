This is a small demo project created while going through the Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.

The project allows one to see a list of "robofriends" and to use a search bar to find and display a certain robofriend -- the purpose of this is to demonstrate the usage of state/hooks.
